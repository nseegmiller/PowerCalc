# PowerCalc
This is a modified recreation of the old Windows XP PowerToy Calculator.

I built this in the late 2000s when I found myself disillusioned with the calculator in Windows Vista. Many modern OS calculators are better now, but this is still very functional calculator for Windows.

# Building
Open the solution file in Visual Studio 2017 and click build. That's it!
